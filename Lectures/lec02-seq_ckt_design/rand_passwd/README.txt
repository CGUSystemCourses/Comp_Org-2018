This folder contains the source code to generate the password for the
digit-lock project.

Replace the line "#define STUDENT_ID 0xB0329001" with your student ID (in hex),
re-compile, and run to obtain your own 4-digit password.

Use the command "make" to generate the password-generation program
"rand_passwd", or the command "make run" to build and run directly.

This program is tested under Linux, and you may need to modify it if you
are to use it on M$-Windows.
